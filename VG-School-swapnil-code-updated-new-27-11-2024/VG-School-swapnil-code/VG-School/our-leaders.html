                </p>
                <p>Ms. Kaur’s ideology of proper education is inspired by and resonates with the profound words of Nelson Mandela, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” She accentuates that holistic education is incomplete without educating the mind and connecting to the soul within. For her, other than the hardware of the school, which is visible, it is equally poignant to emphasise the software known as life skills and value education.
